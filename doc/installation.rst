Installation
============

*STDpipe* is available at https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe and is mirrored at https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/icare/stdpipe.

In order to use it, you will need a working Python (>=3.6) installation, as well as a number of additional Python libraries and external packages. Below you will find some basic instructions how to set it up (using Anaconda environment as an example, but you may use any other as well) if you do not have it already.

Preparing the environment (optional)
------------------------------------

The steps highlighted below are primarily for Linux and MacOS systems.
Windows users are advised to use WSL (preferrably Ubuntu 20.04 or later) for smooth installation.
Ubuntu 20.04 is available for free download on Microsoft Store.

You may safely skip these steps if you already have a working Python environment where you would like to install *STDPipe*.

Installing Miniconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On your Linux/MacOS/WSL terminal, run the following commands to install `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ (or full `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_ if you prefer):

.. prompt:: bash

   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

.. prompt:: bash

   bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Alternatively, you may install full `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_ by following the instructions on their web site.

Now update it to the latest version (you should also do it if you already have Miniconda or Anaconda installed:

.. prompt:: bash

   conda update --all

Optionally, you may create the separate Conda environment that will contain *STDPipe*, and switch to it. Here, as an example, we will select Python 3.10 as default Python interpreter for it:

.. prompt:: bash

   conda create -n stdpipe python=3.10

   conda activate stdpipe

Installing basic dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. prompt:: bash

   conda install numpy scipy astropy matplotlib pandas

Install conda-forge dependencies

.. prompt:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge astroscrappy

Install conda astropy dependencies

.. prompt:: bash

   conda install -c astropy astroquery

Depending on your operating system and availability of pre-compiled Python packages for it, you may also need to have basic development environment (C/C++ compiler etc) installed, either inside the environment or in the base system. E.g. on Ubuntu or Debian it may be installed with

.. prompt:: bash

   sudo apt install gcc

STDPipe installation
--------------------

Clone the STDPipe repository from GitHub at https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe

.. prompt:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe.git

Change directory to the stdpipe folder:

.. prompt:: bash

   cd stdpipe

Use the command below to install the rest of dependencies and the package itself in an *editable* manner so that it will be updated automatically when you update the code:

.. prompt:: bash

   python -m pip install -e .

.. note::

   Alternative installation command (try it if the one above fails - they use slightly different strategies of installing the dependencies, so results may really vary!) would be

   .. prompt:: bash

      python setup.py develop

Keeping up to date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The command above installs the package to your Python environment in an *editable* way - it means that all changes you may make to the source tree (where you cloned the code) will immediately be reflected in the installed package, you do not need to repeat the installation.

As the code base in the repository evolves fast -- new features are being added, bugs fixed, etc -- it is a good idea to update your cloned code from the upstream often. The following command from inside stdpipe folder will do it:

.. prompt:: bash

   git pull


Quick testing the installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following commands inside your python (e.g. after typing :code:`ipython`):

.. prompt:: python

   import stdpipe
   import stdpipe.photometry
   import stdpipe.cutouts
   import stdpipe.subtraction
   import stdpipe.pipeline

NOTE (Okay, last one!): if everything is ok, it's the end of the installation. But in case it shows that such-and-such modules are absent, feel free to install those modules by visiting their conda documentation and install
those with their given commands, or by using pip directly. In case modules like photutils and statsmodels are needed, don't hesitate to do it with pip (normally it shouldn't happen), but some modules may not install correctly in case of disturbance.

This instruction page will likely cover the issues you might face during your installation. However, please open `issues on GitHub <https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe/issues>`_ if there appear to be unresolvable conflicts.

Installation of external packages
---------------------------------

*STDPipe* makes use of a number of (optional) external packages that provides various low-level functionality:

- `SExtractor <https://github.com/astromatic/sextractor>`__
- `SCAMP <https://github.com/astromatic/scamp>`__
- `PSFEx <https://github.com/astromatic/psfex>`__
- `SWarp <https://github.com/astromatic/swarp>`__
- `HOTPANTS <https://github.com/acbecker/hotpants>`__
- `Astrometry.Net <https://github.com/dstndstn/astrometry.net>`__

Most of them are also available in the repositories of various Linux distributions, and may be conveniently installed from there (see below).

HOTPANTS image subtraction package cannot presently (as far as I know) be installed from any package manager, and has to be compiled manually.

.. attention::

   If HOTPANTS compilation fails for you on the linking stage with a number of :code:`multiple definition of` error messages - that's a `known bug <https://github.com/acbecker/hotpants/issues/5>`__ related to some recent changes in GCC compiler defaults. You may easily fix it by editing the :file:`Makefile` and adding :code:`-fcommon` switch among the others in the `COPTS` options (line `30 <https://github.com/acbecker/hotpants/blob/master/Makefile#L30>`__ at the moment of writing).

We have a dedicated script `install_hotpants.sh` that may be used to do it automatically - it will grab the sources, patch it to fix the problem described above, compile, and install the `hotpants` binary to `/usr/local/bin/`. If it fails at any step, you may try to manually fix the issues (the code should be in `/tmp/hotpants` folder) and continue installing it. It may fail e.g. due to missing development environment (compiler/linker/utilities etc), or missing dependencies - it may be installed according to standard recipes for your operating system. E.g. on Ubuntu or Debian it may be done as

.. prompt:: bash

   sudo apt install gcc make libcfitsio-dev

To be able to install the compiled binary to `/usr/local/bin` the script should be run with administrator permissions, e.g. using `sudo`. Otherwise, you may run it from normal user and then manually copy the compiled binary (it will be at `/tmp/hotpants/hotpants`) there later.

Ubuntu
^^^^^^

.. prompt:: bash

   sudo apt install sextractor scamp psfex swarp

Astrometry.Net may also be installed from repository, but might require additional manual configuration steps (and quite a lot of disk space for larger indices!), so install it only when you really need it, and when you really know what you are doing!

.. prompt:: bash

   sudo apt install astrometry.net

Miniconda / Anaconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. prompt:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge astromatic-source-extractor astromatic-scamp astromatic-psfex astromatic-swarp

Conda does not have Astrometry.Net package, so, if you need it, you may install it manually following the instructions on their website.
